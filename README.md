# California SoS Unprocessed Ballots Status

The Secretary of State has [a page for the "unprocessed ballots status"](https://electionresults.sos.ca.gov/unprocessed-ballots-status) which shows how many ballots remain to be procesed in each county.

But that's not machine readable and not set up for CORS requests - so this is a CSV version of that data. Updates are checked for daily.
